			Fade to Black is a single player game in which the player is forced to confront the loss of those around them, as their prospects in life slowly get bleaker until they lose all hope. By using the player's friends against them, this game manages to more greatly manipulate the player's emotions and slowly make them feel more lonely and depressed.

			Fade to Black was a solo project for my CTIN 488 class. We were asked to come up with an emotion and create a game with that emotion in mind. In essence, we were trying to force the players to feel our chosen emotion through gameplay. Emotions chosen by my class included shyness, rage, and terror, and I selected depression.

		</p>

		<p>

			I knew that in order to force the player to feel such a strong emotion, I would have to use something in the player's life against them. In this case, I chose the player's friends and family. Using their friends brings in their existing connections, and manipulating existing relationships allowed me to better control the player's emotions instead of attempting to forge new, strong bonds in a short amount of time. As such, the game begins with players writing the names of their 5 closest friends on slips of paper and placing them on the board.

		</p>

		<p>

			In order to simulate interactions with the player's friends, the player has a deck of cards (without any face cards) at their disposal. They have a hand of 5 cards, and to simulate time constraints they can only interact with up to 3 of their 5 friends at any given time. However, players must spread their time out between all their friends, as not spending time with a friend often enough leads to a natural growing apart and weakening of their friendship.

		</p>

		<p>

			For each friend the player interacts with, a card is drawn from the second, full deck of cards. If the player's card is higher than the drawn card, the friendship grows stronger. If lower, weaker. And if the drawn card is a face card, it represents a dramatic change in the relationship, ending it immediately. The exact situation is left up to the player, so no unrealistic situations are forced upon them.

		</p>

		<p>

			Finally, every time a friend is lost, the player rolls a die. If it is high enough, the player makes a new friend, replacing the lost strip with a new one indicating another close friend. If they fail to roll higher, however, the future chances of replacing a lost friend go down, until it is impossible to make new friends. This is meant to demonstrate that losing a friend could take a toll on a person, making them less likely to go out and make new friends due to sadness over the previous loss.

		</p>

		<p>

			The feedback I had on this game was excellent. Players reacted the way I expected them to, getting angry at losing friends, feeling sad about them, even wanting to quit playing the game to escape from the emotions it was bringing out in them. Overall, I considered this board game a success, and was glad I managed to bring out something resembling my desired emotion in my players.

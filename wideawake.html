			WideAwake is a music-based runner game. Inspired by music festivals, the game follows the player as they make their journey from their village to the Electric Pantheon. On their journey, the player encounters the Bleak, dubstep-inspired monsters that threaten to drain the light and happiness from the world. The player and the world are empowered by doing actions on the beat.

			Over the course of the summer, the design team had weekly meetings to develop the basic gameplay design for the game. When the game was first pitched, it was a 3D adventure game, but over the course of the pitching process the design pivoted to a mobile runner/combat game, and as a result much of the design had to be redone from scratch. For the runner portion of the game, we drew on other music-based games such as Crypt of the Necrodancer and Bit. Trip Runner, as well as infinite runner games such as Subway Surfer and Blades of Brim. For combat, we were drawing on Shadow of Mordor.

			As design lead, I am in charge of a team of 5 designers. Additionally, due to my computer science background, I am the liason between the design and engineering teams, at times even fixing bugs in the codebase or making modifications when variables aren't easily exposed for designers to access.

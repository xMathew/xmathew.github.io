			WideAwake is a music-based runner game. Inspired by music festivals, the game follows the player as they make their journey from their village to the Electric Pantheon. On their journey, the player encounters the Bleak, dubstep-inspired monsters that threaten to drain the light and happiness from the world. The player and the world are empowered by doing actions on the beat.

			WideAwake was an idea that our team lead, Xander Morgan, came up with his freshman year at USC. He pitched WideAwake last year as part of the Advanced Game Project pitching process, and it was selected as one of five games to be developed by students for the 2015-2016 school year. I joined the project after WideAwake was selected, as a designer.

			Over the course of the summer, the design team had weekly meetings to develop the basic gameplay design for the game. When the game was first pitched, it was a 3D adventure game, but over the course of the pitching process the design pivoted to a mobile runner/combat game, and as a result much of the design had to be redone from scratch. For the runner portion of the game, we drew on other music-based games such as Crypt of the Necrodancer and Bit. Trip Runner, as well as infinite runner games such as Subway Surfer and Blades of Brim. For combat, we were drawing on Shadow of Mordor.

			When the school year began, there were issues within the design team and our design lead had conflicts that prevented him from attending all our meetings. In his absence, I slowly took on more authority in the design team until I was officially promoted to Lead Designer in early November.  Around that same time, due to a lack of a functioning prototype of the combat portion of the game, the decision was made to cut combat entirely and focus instead on the runner portion only.

			As design lead, I am in charge of a team of 5 designers. Additionally, due to my computer science background, I am the liason between the design and engineering teams, at times even fixing bugs in the codebase or making modifications when variables aren't easily exposed for designers to access.

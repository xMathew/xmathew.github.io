			Vanishing Point is a 3D first-person puzzle platformer in which the player can manipulate the environment around them to progress through the halls of Meadow Hills Psychiatric Hospital. The player plays as Rose, a patient at Meadow Hills, who is given a piece of technology that allows her to manipulate the size of objects around her. When Rose's roommate and new friend Daisy mysteriously vanishes, Rose must use her power to search the halls of Meadow Hills in an attempt to find her.

			I began working on Vanishing Point while the team lead was creating it as part of CTIN 484/489 - Intermediate Game Development in the spring of 2014. At the time I was in CTIN 404 - Usability Testing for Games, and was partnered with the Vanishing Point team to do usability testing for their game. The team lead, Max Cohen, pitched Vanishing Point as an advanced game project for the 2014-2015 school year, and Vanishing Point was selected to be one of 5 games developed by students that year.

			Over the course of the summer, I helped to develop the main framework in the game that allowed designers to create interactable objects in Unreal using Blueprints without the engineers having to program further functionality for interactions such as opening doors and activating switches.

		</p>

			Once the semester started, due to my previous help providing user testing for the project, I switched roles and remained in charge of all user testing for the project for the rest of development. As Usability Coordinator, I arranged playtests, collected feedback from playtesters, and provided playtest results to the designers and engineers so that levels and game balance could be tweaked.

			Beginning the Spring 2015 semester, I took on a larger role on the team. The design team had lost a member, and was behing in building levels, so while the designers improved the existing three levels we had built by the end of the first semester, I built the final two levels. While building these levels, I continued to serve as Usability Coordinator, helped other designers make adjustments to their levels, and assisted the engineering team with small bugs as needed.

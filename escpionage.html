			eSCpionage was a team project based on my fellow member Joseph Boman's solo game project, also including Daron Lee and Zach Vega-Perkins, meant to instill fear in the player. However, after playtesting, we instead focused on the mechanic of hidden information. Players know which piece is their own, but don't know which piece is any other players', including their partner's. Players are able to move any of the pieces on the board, allowing them to both hurt and harm their partner and their opponents, which fostered distrust amongst all the players.

			This project was mostly team based, however Joseph maintained creative control and final decision making responsibilities. All of us worked to come up with ideas for improving the game, and all of us helped with conducting playtests. This project was interesting because we were limited by the base mechanics involved in Joseph's original game, instead of starting a new game from scratch, and allowed us to work in a team under a creative director, instead of working on more equal footing like other board games made that semester.

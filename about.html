			Hello! My name is Mathew Schacher, and I am currently attending the University of Southern California as both an undergrad and a masters student. I am in my final semester of my undergraduate program, and am in my second semester of graduate level courses. At USC, I am currently the lead designer of team WideAwake, president of the Rainbow Scholars club, and an E-Board member of USC's Queer and Ally Student Assembly.

			I grew up playing a lot of video games, though not on consoles. I played early educational games, and eventually branched out into franchises such as Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda, and eventually Warcraft and the connected Battle.net. I much prefer puzzle and adventure games to shooters, and especially enjoy games with story rich environments. As of late, with less free time, most of my focus is on mobile games, with story-driven indie titles on PC as well when time allows.

			My experience with making video games began when I was in elementary school. I attended a summer camp that taught children how to use GameMaker, and went back for a couple years, with weeks focusing on different types of games. From my interest in game making, I branched out into programming, taking advantage of Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth to take classes in basic C++ during middle school. My interest in programming and game making faded as my interest in astrophysics grew, but was rekindled at the COSMOS program at UCSC, where I spent a month during the summer before senior year of high school learning about games and building my own as part of a team.

		</p>

			As a result of my summer at COSMOS, I applied to USC's Computer Science (Games) program, and while at USC I've learned a lot about game making and have had the chance to participate in the making of several games. I've had the chance to create small games made for class projects, both board games and computer games, and have twice been in a leadership role on games as part of USC's Advanced Game Project capstone course, once as a Usability lead and once as Lead Designer.

		</p>

			In addition to class-related work, I have also spent time on personal projects. I am currently working on expanding Shattered, which began as part of a game design course, and a second mobile game project that I have a basic design for and am making progress with a prototype implementation. Aside from game-related projects, I also find myself tackling theoretical problems for fun, and have on multiple occasions attempted to make progress on finding an efficient algorithm for P=NP.

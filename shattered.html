			Shattered is a 2D puzzle platformer for mobile. In Shattered, the player is able to manipulate the environment by rotating the level and by interacting with some objects in the levels in order to progress.

			Shattered began in the Intermediate Game Design class as Subsumed, without a definitive narrative. I, along with my partner Sean Holaday, and a music student Chris Ian, built Subsumed over the course of the semester. Sean handled most of the programming, I designed all the levels, created the art, and fixed some problematic bugs, and Chris composed the music.

			Sean and I then pitched Subsumed for USC's Advanced Game Project class, renaming the game Shattered and building a narrative to go along with the gameplay. Inspired by the storytelling of Braid, I wanted to tell a story about a knight, Chrys, who's life had been turned upside down, giving her the ability to rotate the world around her. The game would be set in a stained glass universe, and Chrys would be on a journey to put her world back together.

			Despite not being selected to develop Shattered as part of the Advanced Game Project class, I am still working on Shattered in my free time, making progress towards new design tools such as a csv reader for level instantiation, and I have plans on adding in more mechanics that can add to variation in level designs.
